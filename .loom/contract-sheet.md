# Contract Sheet

> Interface contracts defining preconditions, postconditions, and invariants.
> Contracts are agreements between components — they define what must be true.

## Format

  POST: <what will be true after successful completion>
  INV: <what must remain true throughout>
  status: active | deprecated
  owner: <agent or module>
