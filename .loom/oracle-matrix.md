# Oracle Matrix

> Verification tests linked to claims and contracts.
> An oracle defines how to know if something is true or working.

## Oracles

<!-- Add new entries below. Use sequential IDs. -->

ORACLE-001: Compression goal retention
  verifies: CLAIM-001
  method: test
  command: pytest tests/test_phase4.py::TestCompression::test_compress_state_includes_goal_context -q
  expected: test passes and compressed output contains goal context
  last_run: 2026-02-13
  result: pass
  notes: Confirms safety check that re-injects goal when omitted.

ORACLE-002: Prefetch prediction quality
  verifies: CLAIM-002
  method: test
  command: pytest tests/test_phase4.py::TestPrefetch::test_predict_next_from_sequence -q
  expected: top prediction for anchor 'goal' is 'constraints'
  last_run: 2026-02-13
  result: pass
  notes: Validates transition-learning behavior.

ORACLE-003: Calibration brier sanity
  verifies: CLAIM-003
  method: test
  command: pytest tests/test_phase4.py::TestCalibration::test_fit_updates_parameters_and_improves_brier -q
  expected: report generated with finite brier metrics and persisted params
  last_run: 2026-02-13
  result: pass
  notes: Loader hardened for empty/invalid calibration file.

ORACLE-004: Time-travel replay endpoint
  verifies: CLAIM-004
  method: test
  command: pytest tests/test_phase4.py::TestPhase4ServerEndpoints::test_events_replay -q
  expected: endpoint returns reconstructed state payload with L1/L2/L3 shape
  last_run: 2026-02-13
  result: pass
  notes: Server now records state mutations into event store.

ORACLE-005: Full regression suite
  verifies: CONTRACT-001
  method: test
  command: pytest tests/ -q
  expected: complete suite passes
  last_run: 2026-02-13
  result: pass
  notes: 241 tests passing.

ORACLE-006: Phase 4 metric gates regression
  verifies: CLAIM-005
  method: test
  command: pytest tests/test_phase4.py -q && pytest tests/ -q
  expected: metric tests and full suite pass with bounded quality outputs
  last_run: 2026-02-13
  result: pass
  notes: Added 6 metric-specific tests; full suite now at 247 passes.

ORACLE-007: Runtime write-back automation
  verifies: CLAIM-006
  method: test
  command: pytest tests/test_loom_writeback.py tests/test_phase4.py -q && pytest tests/ -q
  expected: endpoint/utility tests pass and full suite remains green
  last_run: 2026-02-13
  result: pass
  notes: Added dedicated writeback tests; full suite now at 252 passes.

ORACLE-008: CI guard hardening regression
  verifies: CLAIM-007
  method: test
  command: pytest tests/ -q
  expected: suite remains green after workflow guard changes
  last_run: 2026-02-13
  result: pass
  notes: Workflow logic updated; guidance and scoped matching validated by review and regression run.

ORACLE-009: Guard activation smoke oracle
  verifies: CLAIM-008
  method: consistency-check
  command: python -m pytest tests/ -q
  expected: Command succeeds and writeback IDs are produced
  last_run: 2026-02-13
  result: pass
  notes: Auto-generated by runtime write-back.

ORACLE-010: 24x7 watchdog local smoke
  verifies: CLAIM-009
  method: consistency-check
  command: python scripts/loom_watchdog.py --root . --max-stale-days 7
  expected: Reports healthy with non-zero ART/CLAIM/ORACLE/SCAR counts
  last_run: 2026-02-13
  result: pass
  notes: Confirms watchdog logic and freshness gate behavior.
